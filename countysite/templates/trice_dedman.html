                        Tucked between Lathrop and Plattsburg along Highway 116, the Trice-Dedman Memorial Woods 
                        offers a rare glimpse into Nature&apos;s past. This 60-acre sanctuary, maintained by the 
                        Nature Conservancy, is one of Clinton County&apos;s treasurers. It preserves one of the 
                        few remaining examples of upland oak woodlands that once covered much of northwest Missouri.

                        Wander through old-growth white oak trees, some more than 180 years old, and marvel at the

                        With nearly 200 native plant species, the woods come alive with vibrant spring flowers like 
                        violets, trout lilies, and Dutchman&apos;s breeches. Lucky visitors might even spot rare
