                      Public Art in Clinton County
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      Public art comes alive in Clinton County, where murals, sculptures, and restored ghost signs tell the stories 
                      of our past and celebrate our present. Stroll through Plattsburg and discover its artistic treasures, starting 
                      with the large mural at Maple and Main, which depicts the historic Jefferson Highway. Across the street, a 
                      beautiful mural honors the county&apos;s connection to nature, focusing on the importance of birds. Just up the 
                      road at Main and Broadway, another mural captures the charm of rural life.

                      Public art also soars at the DeFreece Real Estate building in Plattsburg, where metal birds take flight above the 
                      streets. Near the county courthouse, you&apos;ll find the iconic statue of David Rice Atchison, famously claimed 
                      to have been U.S. president for a day. The exterior of the courthouse itself is home to whimsical art, including 
                      a painting of the original courthouse for Missouri&apos;s bicentennial and vintage black-and-white photos of Main 
                      Street from a century ago.
