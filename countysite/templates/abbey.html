                    Few spots on earth offer the kind of spiritual harmony you&apos;ll find at the Abbey of Benedictines of Mary, 
                    Queen of Apostles. It is a holy spot where faith and serenity meet marvel and curiosity in one of Clinton 
                    County&apos;s most unusual sites to visit. Surrounded by farms and woods near Gower, Missouri, the Abbey 
                    welcomes you to attend Mass and stroll the grounds where the convent&apos;s sisters live a life of prayer, 
                    work and music.

                        The Abbey gained more national fame in the summer of 2023 for an occurrence that some describe as a miracle. 
                        The sisters disinterred the body of the Abbey&apos;s founder, Sister Wilhelmina, to transfer it to a newly 
                        completed place of honor inside the church. When they opened the coffin, they found that the body and its 
                        clothing were still intact after four years in a grave. That summer more than 15,000 pilgrims came to the 
                        abbey talking of miracles and searching for grace.
