                        If you visit during Mass, you may hear the sisters&apos; renowned liturgical choir, which earned 
                        Billboard&apos;s Classical Traditional Artists awards in 2012 and 2013 for their beautiful albums. The 
                        Abbey gained further attention in 2023 when the body of its founder, Sister Wilhelmina, was found intact 
                        after four years in the grave&mdash;a phenomenon some call miraculous. That summer, over 15,000 pilgrims 
                        visited the Abbey, drawn by faith, hope, and the search for grace.
