                    Golf courses seem more at home in the country than in the city. No highway noise in the background. No long lines 
                    at the tee boxes. No snobs in the pro shop. All of which explains why Plattsburg Country Club Golf Course 
                    is such a pleasure to play.<br>
                    Our course features stimulating layouts without the high greens fees you pay for city courses and tee times are 
                    easier to acquire.

                    This course has been challenging golfers since 1921. Its par 71 layout is 6,250 yards of unique holes designed by 
                    Jeff Klaiber, a former Pete Dye architect. It rolls through hills, across a couple of creeks and around ponds. The 
                    fairways are bluegrass; the undulating greens are bentgrass. New ownership has taken great pride in making the 
                    course a joy to play, and it is also memorably scenic. For more information:
