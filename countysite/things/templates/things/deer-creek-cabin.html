                    In 1991, Beverly McCulloch and her late husband Ron came across a log cabin built in 1829 on a neighboring 
                    property just south of Plattsburg. They bought the cabin, moved it log by log to their farm and lovingly 
                    rebuilt it in a grove of trees.

                    Reconstruction took three years of hand labor and ingenuity. The McCullochs have long family histories in 
                    the area, and they outfitted the cabin to preserve as much history as possible. Now Beverly invites visitors 
                    to relive pioneer life as it was when Andrew Jackson was president.

                    A retired school teacher, Beverly makes sure each visit is a learning experience with family lore and stories 
                    of Clinton County history. Inside the one-room cabin she gives hands-on lessons about frontier skills including 
                    coffee grinding, candle dipping, churning butter and shelling corn cobs. Visitors have come from as far away as 
                    Plattsburgh, New York, to share in the Deer Creek Cabin experience.
