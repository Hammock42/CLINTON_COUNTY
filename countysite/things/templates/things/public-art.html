                <p class="section-text">
                    Public art comes alive in Clinton County, where murals, sculptures, and restored ghost signs tell the stories 
                    of our past and celebrate our present. Stroll through Plattsburg and discover its artistic treasures, starting 
                    with the large mural at Maple and Main, which depicts the historic Jefferson Highway. Across the street, a 
                    beautiful mural honors the county&apos;s connection to nature, focusing on the importance of birds. Just up the 
                    road at Main and Broadway, another mural captures the charm of rural life.

                    Public art also soars at the DeFreece Real Estate building in Plattsburg, where metal birds take flight above the 
                    streets. In front of the county courthouse, you&apos;ll find the iconic statue of David Rice Atchison, famously 
                    claimed to have been U.S. president for a day. The exterior of the courthouse itself is home to whimsical art, 
                    including a painting of the original courthouse for Missouri&apos;s bicentennial and vintage black-and-white 
                    photos of Main Street from a century ago.
