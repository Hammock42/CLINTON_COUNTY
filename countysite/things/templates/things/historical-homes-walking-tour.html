                    Folks around here brag about the beautiful homes in Plattsburg. And they&apos;re right, Plattsburg has an enviable 
                    inventory of century-old homes including Queen Anne style, Victorians full of gingerbread embellishments and 
                    something unique called Steamboat Gothic.

                    We have captivating churches, too. First Christian Church &lpar;501 W. Clay Avenue&rpar; is a brick marvel built in 
                    1891. If you&apos;re looking for a newly renovated old church that is once again true to its origins, check out St. 
                    Ann&apos;s Catholic Church, 700 W. Maple Street. The red brick beauty was originally built in 1888 and changed with 
                    the times. But in the 2020s, parishioners performed a stunning interior renovation that took the church back to its 
                    original glory.
