                <p class="section-text">
                    At Dandelion Creek Company, we craft every bar of small-batch soap using milk from our own Alpine and Saanen goats, raised right here on our farm just outside of Plattsburg, Missouri. Our shop isn&apos;t just a place to buy soap&ndash;it&apos;s a place to slow down, breathe in calming scents, and see where real, handcrafted skincare begins.

                <p id="paragraph-2" class="section-text">
                    We were honored to receive <b>1st Place in the 2025 Best of Rural Missouri</b>, and we&apos;re proud to represent the heart of rural craftsmanship. Travelers often say stepping into our soapery feels like visiting a friend&apos;s farmhouse&ndash;warm, welcoming, and full of delightful surprises. From the scent of fresh lavender in the air to the sight of soap curing on the racks, every detail reflects the care we put into our work. Whether you&apos;re exploring Plattsburg, Clinton County, or making a dedicated trip, our little corner of the countryside is worth the stop.

                    Handcrafted Goat Milk Soap
                </h2>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Our soaps are made the old-fashioned way&ndash;with time, care, and only the best ingredients. We start with <b>fresh goat milk</b>, sourced from our own herd, and blend it with nourishing oils like olive, coconut, and shea. Then we add soothing extras like <b>oatmeal, honey, herbs, clays, and essential oils</b>&ndash;no synthetic detergents or fillers, ever.
                    <br>
                    Each bar is hand-poured, hand-cut, and hand-stamped right here in our soap kitchen. We believe in small-batch quality over mass production, which means you get a bar that&apos;s gentle, long-lasting, and beautiful from the first lather to the last sliver.
                    <br>
                    Looking for something unscented and ultra-soothing? Our <b>Oatmeal Honey Goat Milk Soap</b> is a favorite among people with sensitive skin, eczema, and little ones. Prefer something more fragrant? We offer a variety of options&ndash;some scented purely with <b>essential oils</b> for those who love natural aromatherapy, and others with <b>fun seasonal scents</b> like frosted gingerbread or sweet tea that bring a smile to your day.

                <p id="paragraph-3" class="section-text">
                    From cleansing to gift-giving, we have a bar for every body&ndash;and everybody deserves better soap.

                <p class="section-text">
                    The magic starts with our goats. Every morning, we rise with the sun and head to the barn, where our <b>Alpine and Saanen goats</b> wait &lpar;often not-so-patiently&rpar; to be milked. They&apos;re more than just part of the process&ndash;they&apos;re part of our family. With unique personalities, favorite scratching spots, and an occasional mischievous streak, these goats are the heart of everything we do.
                    <br>
                    That morning milk goes directly into the soap we make in our on-site workspace. This <b>farm-to-skin freshness</b> makes all the difference. It&apos;s how we keep our soaps creamy, gentle, and full of natural nutrients your skin will love.
                    <br>
                    If you visit in the springtime, you&apos;re in for an extra treat&ndash;<b>baby goat season!</b> Behind the shop, you&apos;ll often see our tiniest farm members bouncing, napping in the sun, or nibbling at your shoelaces. Guests of all ages can schedule a time to bottle-feed a baby goat, a heartwarming experience that adds a whole new level of joy to your visit. It&apos;s messy, it&apos;s adorable, and it might just be your favorite part of the trip.
                </p>
                <p id="paragraph-4" class="section-text">
                    Come for the soap&ndash;stay for the goats. Or maybe, come for the goats and leave with the best soap you&apos;ve ever tried.
