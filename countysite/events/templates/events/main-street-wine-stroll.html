                    Imagine a sunny Saturday in May, strolling the cordoned off streets of a charming small town, a sample glass of wine 
                    in one hand, a delectable from a food truck in the other. If that&apos;s your idea of a good time, come to Plattsburg 
                    the third Saturday in May for the town&apos;s annual Main Street Stroll.

                    If you prefer shopping to sipping, enjoy Vendors&apos; Row, where local artisans showcase handmade crafts, early 
                    spring plants, and unique finds. A DJ keeps the energy lively, and dance lovers are invited to show off their 
                    Two Step moves. With live music at venues like The Backyard and a tasty array of food truck options, there&apos;s
